  <h2 id="iron"><b>KOHLI</b></h2>
</center>
   <p id="1" >Virat Kohli (Hindi: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦliː] (listen); born 5 November[3] 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India national cricket team. He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League as a right-handed batsman.

    Kohli made his Test debut in 2011.[4] He reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013.[5]  He has won Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). He also holds the world record of being the fastest to score 23,000 international career runs.[6]
    
    Kohli has been the recipient of many awards– most notably the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Men's Cricketer of the Decade): 2011–2020; Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) in 2017 and 2018; ICC Test Player of the Year (2018); ICC ODI Player of the Year (2012, 2017, 2018) and Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World (2016, 2017 and 2018).[7] At the national level, he was awarded the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017[8] and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the highest sporting honour in India, in 2018.[9]
    
    In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN[10] and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.[11] In 2018, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[12] In 2020, he was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of over $26 million.[13]</p>

      <h2 id="thor"><b>AB DEVILLIERS</b></h2>
    </center>
      <p >Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a former South African international cricketer. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[2] He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport.

        AB de Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, as well as one of the greatest of all time, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[3] He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.[4] In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player.[5] He holds the record for the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls.
        
        De Villiers captained South Africa in all three formats, although after a series of injuries, he stepped down from the Test captaincy. In 2017, he stepped down from captaining the national limited-overs games[6] and in May 2018, he announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket.[7][8][9] In January 2020, however, de Villiers expressed an interest in making an international comeback and play in the 2020 T20 World Cup, [10] although later in the year it was confirmed that he would not do so.[11][12][13] On 19 November 2021, De Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[14]</p>

      <h2 id="spider"><b>BEN STOKES</b></h2>
    </center>
      <p >Benjamin Andrew Stokes OBE (born 4 June 1991) is an English cricketer who is the captain of the England Test team[2] and plays for the England Twenty20 International (T20I) team.[3] In domestic cricket, he represents Durham and has played in multiple Twenty20 leagues, including the Indian Premier League, playing for Rising Pune Supergiant and Rajasthan Royals.

        Born in New Zealand, Stokes moved to England as a child.[4] He made his T20I debut in 2011, his Test debut in 2013, and played for England's One Day International (ODI) team from 2011 before retiring from the format in July 2022.[5] He was part of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, top-scoring in England's innings in the final before batting in the tied Super Over, winning the Man of the Match award. He was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2019 and 2020, and won the ICC Award for Best Men's Cricketer and BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in 2019. He was appointed captain of England's Test team in April 2022.[6] As of November 2022, he is ranked as the number two Test all-rounder in the world in the ICC Men's Player Rankings.[7]
        
        An all-rounder, Stokes is a left-handed middle-order batsman and right-arm fast bowler. He holds the Test world record for most runs in an innings at number six, scoring 258 against South Africa during England's 2015-16 tour.[8] In the same Test, he and Jonny Bairstow set the world record for highest sixth-wicket stand in Tests, at 399.[9]</p>
